### Project Overview
The data project aims to provide insights into the trends and patterns of data scientist professionals over the past few years. By analyzing various aspects of the data scientist dataset, I was able to make data-driven recommendations and gain imperative insights about that dataset.

### Data Sources
Data Scientists: The primary database used for analysis is the "ds_salaries.csv" with the following headers: company size, company location, employee residence, employment type, experience level, job title, remote ratio, salary, work year.

### Tools 
Excel - Utilized for importing the dataset from www.kaggle.com
Power Bi - Utilized for data cleaning to check if there were missing values and duplicate records across  each Column  within the dataset with the help of power query,
Visualization was also created with Power Bi.

###  Data Cleaning/Preparing
In the initial data preparation, the following tasks were performed:

1.	Data loading and inspection.
2.	Handling missing values.
3.	Checking for duplicate values.
4.	Converting each header to the correct data type.
5.	Outlier detection and handling.
6.	Handling inconsistent data and typos.


###  Exploration Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved answering key questions such as:

1.	Finding the top five percentage salaries for job titles.
2.	Determining the average salary by experience level and employee residence.
3.	Analyzing the average salary by company size and experience level.
4.	Evaluating the average salary by company location.
5.	Determining the total salary for job titles and experience levels.
6.	Analyzing the average salary for job titles and employment types.
7.	Finding the average remote ratio by year and experience level.
8.	Identifying salary trends by year.
9.	Determining the total salary by experience level and remote ratio.



### Results/Findings
Insights gleaned from the analysis include:

1.	Data engineers have the highest percentage of salary in the dataset.
2.	The United States of America has the highest average salary for each experience level.
3.	"Expert" level employees earn the highest average salary across different company sizes.
4.	Illinois location has the highest average salary in the dataset for each company location.
5.	Data scientist jobs have seen rapid growth, with 2023 having the highest total salary earned.
6.	Senior-level data engineers earn the highest salary.
7.	Full-time machine learning positions offer the highest average salary.
8.	"Expert" level remote jobs with a 100% remote ratio have the highest average salary.
9.	Senior-level experience has the highest total salary, regardless of remote ratio.



### Limitation
To enhance the analysis report for visualization, columns with headers such as employment type, experience level, and company size were transformed to provide clearer context.


### Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were made:

1.	Prioritize hiring skilled data engineers to bolster analytics infrastructure.
2.	Explore opportunities in the U.S. for higher average salaries across experience levels.
3.	Invest in expertise development, particularly in roles labeled as "Expert."
4.	Evaluate opportunities in Illinois, known for its high average salaries.
5.	Focus recruitment efforts on data scientist roles due to their rapid growth and high compensation.
6.	Recognize senior-level contributions with competitive salaries and advancement opportunities.
7.	Offer competitive compensation for full-time machine learning positions.
8.	Clarify remote job criteria to avoid confusion in descriptions and compensation.
9.	Assess the impact of remote work on salary structures and adjust policies accordingly.
