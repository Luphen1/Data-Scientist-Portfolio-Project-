### Project Overview
The data project aims to provide an insight about  trend and pattern of data scientist professionals over the past few years. By analyzing various aspects of the data scientist dataset, I was able to make data-driven recommendation and gaining imperative insights about that dataset

### Data Sources
Data Scientist:The primary database used for analysis is the  "ds_salaries.csv" having the following headers company_size, company location, employee residence,employment type, experience level,job title, remote ratio,salary, work year

### Tools 
Excel - Excel is used for importing the dataset from www.kaggle.com
Power Bi - is used for data cleaning to check if there are missing values and duplicate records across  each Column   within the  spreadsheet.
Visualization report are also created in using power Bi 

###  Data Cleaning/Preparing
In the initial data preparation, I performed the following tasks below;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling for missing value
3. Checking for duplicate values
4. Convert each headers to  the right  data type

###  Exploration Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the heart_attack data to answer key questions such as

1. Find top five percentage salary for job title
2. Find the average salary of  experience level and employee residence
3. What is the average salary by company size and experience level
4. Average Salary salary by company location 
5. What is the total salary for job title and experience level
6. What is the average salary for job title and employment type
7. Find the average remote ratio by year and experience level
8. Find the salary trend by year
9. What is the total salary by experience level and remote ratio


### Results/Findings
1. Data engineer has the highest percentage of salary in the dataset
2. United State of America has the highest average salary for each experience level across that dataset 
3. Expert occurs to have the most average salary for experience level In each company sizes
4. Illinois location has the highest average salary in the dataset for each company location
5. Data scientist jobs had grown so fast across the year ,2023 has the highest  total salary earned
6. Senior experience level of data engineer  has the most earned salary 
7. Machine learning of employment type full time has the highest average salary
8. Expert remote job of 100 has  the average salary 
9. Experience senior level has the highest total salary of remote ratio of 0 and 100



### Limitation
- Columns with header employment type,experience level and  company size context won't give a concise and analysis,I had to each of the headers a readable context to enhance analysis report and for a better understanding
